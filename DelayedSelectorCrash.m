In Objective-C, a subtle bug can occur when using `performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:` with selectors that have arguments. If the object whose selector is being performed is deallocated before the delay expires, a crash can occur due to sending a message to a deallocated object. This is less common than other memory management issues but still poses a risk.  The typical error message may not clearly pinpoint the root cause, making it harder to debug.
